An app to check the weather with!

## Installation
Since I only used links and HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, and jQuery all you need to do to run my site locally, is clone it!

## Usage
You may add a city to the search bar and click search. It will add the city to the sidebar menu. From there you click the cities in order to display their weather information.

Everything is stored in local storage too, so if you close the page, it will save your search queries!

Website is fully responsive on different screen sizes!

## Credits
I used Bootstrap to style my project. Access [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) on their webiste!

I used jQuery to help with events! Access [jQuery](https://https://jquery.com/) on their website!
